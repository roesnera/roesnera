### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am Adam Roesner, a Full Stack Web Developer (most experienced with React/Spring Boot/MySQL) and a web development teacher. I am constantly working to learn new skills and tools to expand my abilities. I have a passion for finding the right tool for the job and I am always looking for constructive feedback on my work!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my CI/CD skills by implementing a rigid deployment pipeline and testing suite on my current professional projects.

Outside of work, I have a passion for staying active, I love to ride my bike ðŸšµ, train in mma ðŸ¥Š, play guitar ðŸŽ¸, and read ðŸ“š.

This winter I am training to be able to run a marathon in the fall of next year.
